# Private Section: Overview

The `private` section of Chronicle Kit is designed to provide a safe and confidential space for documenting your most personal and internal thoughts. Unlike other sections of the project, the content within this folder will not be used in scripts or summaries meant for sharing with others. This allows you to capture private reflections, feelings, and experiences without concern about unintended visibility or disclosure.

This section is intended to be for your eyes only, unless you choose otherwise. It is a place to document:

- Your deepest thoughts and emotions
- Dreams and aspirations
- Unresolved traumas
- Personal goals
- Drafts of private letters to loved ones

## Subsections
The `private` folder includes the following subsections to help organize your thoughts:

### 1. **Draft Letters**
This folder can hold letters youâ€™ve written to important people in your life. These letters may be meant for sharing at some point or simply for personal reflection.

### 2. **Dreams**
Document your dreams, whether they are goals for the future, recurring themes in your sleep, or imaginative ideas that inspire you.

### 3. **Feelings**
A place to reflect on your emotions, process challenging times, and explore your inner world.

### 4. **Goals**
Capture your personal, professional, or aspirational goals, along with reflections on your progress and motivations.

### 5. **Trauma**
A safe space to process and document unresolved traumas, allowing you to explore these experiences privately and at your own pace.

## Notes on Usage
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensure that the content in this folder is kept secure, as it may include highly sensitive information.
2. **Flexibility**: Feel free to create additional subfolders or customize the structure to suit your needs.
3. **Optional Sharing**: While this section is intended to remain private, you may choose to share specific content with trusted individuals if and when you feel ready.
