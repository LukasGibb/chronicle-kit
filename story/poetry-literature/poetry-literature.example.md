# Example Questions for the `Poetry & Literature` Section

Below are example questions to help you reflect on and document your connection with poetry and literature. This section is designed to capture your own creative works, as well as the poems or literary pieces that have inspired or resonated with you.

Please copy this file into the `story/poetry-literature/` folder and rename it to reflect the specific poem, piece of literature, or collection you are documenting, such as `my-poems.md`, `shakespeare-sonnets.md`, or `favorite-quotes.md`.

You may also want to create a separate file to include the actual text of the poem or literary piece, or you can include it above or below the questions in the same file.
