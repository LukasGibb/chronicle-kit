# Example Questions for the `Education` Section

Below are example questions to help you document your educational experiences. These questions are generic enough to apply to any level of education. You can copy this file into the appropriate folder (e.g., `primary/`, `secondary/`, etc.) and rename it to reflect the specific educational stage you are documenting, such as `primary.md` or `secondary.md`.

Alternatively, you may choose to remove the subfolders and use this file directly for each educational stage you wish to document.
